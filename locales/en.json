Care must, however, be exercised when opening new accounts either for Institutional, businesses or private individuals. Customer references have to be themselves checked for authenticity and reliability. GTC staff are duty bound to record detailed evidence of each customer’s identity. The nature of the identity given to us should be photocopied and retained in our records along with the relevant dates when it was submitted. Where facilities are required, we must know the precise purpose (and subsequently check to see that the facility has been used for that purpose) and, of course, the terms and source of repayment or settlement of the facility. It is advisable, from time to time, to call on the business premises to see if it appears to be, prima facie, conducting itself within the description given to the GTC E.g. manufacturer, Producer. hedger, retail trader, etc. It should be noted that corporate accounts are one of the most likely vehicles for money laundering.",

All debits/ transfers should be crossed “Account Payee” to stop them being handed on and passed through a bank other than that of the bank holder. Business accounts require a special scrutiny especially those that are handling a fair amount of turnover and accounts which are very active.
